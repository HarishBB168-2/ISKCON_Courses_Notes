Title : History of Gaudiya Vaishnavism

- Gaudiya Vaishnavism
* Gaudiya - Vaishavs belonging to Gaud desh
* Gaud desh - Gaurang Mahaprabhu ke anugat sthan (today's bengal)

- Vaishnav - devotees of Bhagwan Vishnu Ji.
- Karshnav - devotees of Bhagwan Shri Krishna Ji.
- Gaudiya Vaishnav - devotees of Sri Radha Krishna Ji, 
with servitude especially towards Shrimati Radhika.

- Shrimati Radhika
* Female counter part of God
* Krishna aatmika
* Very essence of Shri Krishna is Shrimati Radhika
* Higher self of Krishna

- The Fall and the Rise of Bhakti (Spirituality)
* -1 : Dharma ka patan (Paap ke karya prarambh)
* 0 : Shunyavaad (Mahatma Buddh)
* 1 : Advait Siddhant (Shankaracharya)
* 2 : Dwaitvaad (Madhvacharya)
* Anant : Achintya-bhed-abhed (Shri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu)

- Dharm ka patan (Paap ke karya prarambh)
* Kaliyug ke start mai.
> Shri Parikshit ji facing Kaliyug personified beating Cow (Prithvi) and Bull (Dharm).
> Misusing of Brahminical powers by Rishi Sringi Ji.
>> So Brahminical power started reducing in Brahmans generation by generation.
> Brahmans learning started reducing, divine connection also started reducing.
> Situation became such worse, that Brahamans started exploiting other castes too much.
> Ghamand of Brahmanvaad started.
* Due such amount of exploitation of lower caste people, they left Sanatan Dharma, and
its practices.
> And they become absolutely uncivilized.
* Due to this Prophets and Messengers came to make them a bit civilized as 
different religion.
* Among all the dharmas, Buddha dharma was most satoguni.

- Shunyavaad (Shri Mahatma Buddh Ji)
* Paap ke karya band karwaye.
* Shunyavaad ka prachar kiya.
* Jab tak existence hai, tab tak janm-mrityu ka chakra hai, paap and sansaar hai.
* This all finishes when we enter the existence of non-existence.
* Ahimsa paramo dharma
> Even Brahamns were also eating meat on the name of animal sacrifice.
>> Animal sacrifice is banned in Kali-yuga.
* Refusing Vedas and Shashtra
* No information regarding - soul, Bhagwan, bhakti.
* Purpose of this dharma was to make people moral and satvik.
* Philosophy : Merging in voidness.

- Advait Siddhant (Shri Shankaracharya Ji)
* Bringing shashtra into life.
> Upanishad
* In short span of 32 years, buddhism removed from boundaries of India.
* Philosophy : Existence of non-existence
> Merging in Nirakar Brahm-jyoti.
> Information about soul exists.
> No information about Bhagwan and bhakti.

[Vishist Advaitvaad (Shri Ramanujacharya Ji) (1.5)
+ Both Atma and Parmatma exist with relationship of bhakti.
+ Vishisht Advaitvaad.]

- Dwaitvaad (Sripad Madhvacharya Ji)
* Completely refute Advait.
* 2 - Two

* Connected to lineage vaishnav Sampradaya of Sripad Madhvacharya Ji.
* Shri Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Ji
> Shri Krishna Himself.
* Philosophy :
> There exists an inconceivable difference as well as oneness.
> Sun and sunshine - heat and light same, but difference is also there.
> A citized and a King - having same body parts but difference is also there.
> Difference 90%, Commonality 10%

- 4 Pramanik Sampradaya
<Sampradaya - Aacharya (HOD)>
* Brahma - Shri Madhvacharya Ji
* Shiv - Shri Vishnu Swami Ji
* Laxmi - Shri Ramanujacharya Ji

- Taken from each sampradaya
* Brahma Sampradaya
> Mayavaad siddhant khandan
> Shri Vigraha Sewa
* Rudra Sampradaya
> Raga-nuga bhakti
> Krishna ki ek matra sharan lena
* Shri Sampradaya
> Hari Bhakto ki sewa
> Shuddh bhakti ka palan
* Kumar Sampradaya
> Shrimati Radhika ki sharan
> Gopiyo ki prema-bhakti

- Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu = Sri Krishna + Srimati Radharani

- Dwait-vaad + Rasa-tattva = Achintya-Bhed-Abhed
* Rasa-tattva is given by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

- Why Achintya-Bhed-Abhed tattva was not given by Shri Madhvacharya Ji.
* At that time his important role was that to cutting Adwait philosophy.
* Achintya-Bhed-Abhed tattva was too delicate for audience at that time to
digest.
* Madhu + Va + Acharya = Sweetness of Bhakti + Divya-gyan + dene wale Acharya

- Lord Chaitanya and Six Goswamis
* Lord Chaitanya empowered Six Goswamis for writing Shashtras.
