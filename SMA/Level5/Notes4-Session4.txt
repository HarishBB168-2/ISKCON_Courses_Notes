In the Age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting
to worship the incarnation of Godhead who constantly sings
the names of Kṛṣṇa. Although His complexion is not blackish, 
He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, 
weapons and confidential companions.

mayapure navadvipe bhavisyami saci-sutah

In the first part of Kali-yuga (Yuga-Sandhya / transition period of 10,000 years),
I will appear in my complete spiritual form in Mayapura, Navadvipa and become the son
of Shachi.

In the first part of Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord in the golden complexion will
become the husband of Lakshmi. Then He will become a sannyasi and reside near
Lord Jagannatha.

bhagirathi-tate ramie bhavisyami saci-sutah

I shall take birth as the son of Shachi assuming a golden form in a
beautiful place on the bank of the Bhagirathi (Ganges) on the earth
in the first part of Kali-yuga.

appearance of Lord Chaitanya.
