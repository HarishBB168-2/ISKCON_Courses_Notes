Session 7 : 18.03.2024
Title : Meditation Retreat

- What do we mean by meditation?
* Meditation means thinking of the Lord within
* Meditation means stopping all nonsensical activites, 
at least for the time being.
* Meditation means thinking of Krishna always (satatam cintayanot mam)
* Meditation means to achieve a state in which the mind 
is saturated with God consciousness.
* Meditation means to try to understand one's 
relationship with the Supreme.
* Meditation means analyzing the self and searching 
for the Absolute Truth.

- Meditation recommended for this age
* As per Brihad Naradiya Purana - 
Harer Namaiva Kevalam.
* Shrimad Bhagavatam - Kaler dosha-nidhe rajan
* Problems infront of Shri Bhimsen
> Symptoms of Kaliyuga
1. Bada eaten the kheti - rakshak becoming bhakshak
2. Glasses filled from jug cannot fill the jug - parents can
grow the children, but children can't take care of parents.
3. Hathi can go through hole of needle, but tail of hathi is 
stuck in the hole - Big criminal are free, but small criminal in jails.
4. Cow killed the calf and eaten - Mothers will kill the baby
in their womb selfishly.
5. Boy in neighbourhood bounds the mountains with thread and 
destorys them - Hari naam will destory mountains of sins.

- Hari naam glories
* Simply by chanting one holy name of Hari, a sinful man can 
counteract the reactions to more sins than he is able to commit. 
(Brihad Vishnu Purana)
* Naam-apradh :- using hari naam as washing intentional sins, 
will create 5 million times result of sins.
* Chanting of Lord Hari's name cures all diseases, removes all 
obstacles, and rescues one from all calamities. 
(Brihad Vishnu Purana)
* It is the nature of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra that anyone 
who chants it immediately devlops his loving ecstasy for Krishna. 
(Skanda Purana)
* In the relative world, the word water and the substance water 
are different. When I am thirsty, if I simply chant "Water, water, 
water," my thirst will not be satisfied. I require the real water. 
That is the nature of the relative world and relative consciousness. 
But in the spiritual world or spiritual consciousness, the chanting
twenty-four hours a day, you'll never become tired. This is the 
spiritual nature of the Absolute Truth. This is practical.
Anyone can perceive it. -- Srila Prabhupada.

- What should we chant?
* Hare Krishna... - Kali Santaran Upanishad
* Types of names
> Secondary names (Connected to opulences, vibhuti, aishwarya)
Sarv-vyapi, Sarv-sakshi, Sarv-shaktiman
Alla-hu-akbar, Christ
> Primary names (Connected to lila)
More effective
Krishna, Shyam-sundar, Yashoda-nandan,
Nanda-nandan, Govinda, Gopinath
> Madhurya names
Most effective
Hare Krishna mahamantra

- What are the benefits we expect from meditation (Chanting)?
* It armors us from bad association (on body, chetna, buddhi, mana)
* It expands the time for us

* Clarity of intelligence
* Problems become either become small or non-existent
* **LOVE FOR SUPREME LORD KRISHNA!**

- Lets Begin...
* Panchatatva mantra
* Hare Krishna mantra
* In Mala 
Meru is Krishna
108 
* One Krishna, Eight main categories of shakti

- What are the possible obstacles in meditation (chanting)?
* Exercise:
My mind is like a _____.
Because - ______.

- Why the sweetest holy name not sounding sweet?
* The holy name, characer, pastimes and activities of Krishna are
all transcendentally sweet like sugar candy. Although the tongue 
of one afflicted by the jaundice of avidya [ignorance] cannot 
taste anything sweet, it is wonderful that simply by carefully 
chanting these sweet names every day, a natural relish awakens 
within his tongue, and his disease is destroyed at the root.

* Do's

> **Clear pronunciation**
> **Early morning is best time**
> Drink water when ever feeling sleepy
> Prefer taking bath before Japa
> **Focus on hearing each name**
> Chant prayerfully -- seeking shelter
> Fixing a number of rounds
* Dont's

> While chanting - Don't gossip, watch TV, surf internet,
drive a vehicle or any such distracting activity.
> Don't change in mind
> Don't ragado-fy the chanting!
> **Don't imagine any thing**

- A letter to the Holy Name - Hare Krishna
* My Dear Holy Name - Oh Radha Krishna Naam!
Please accept my hearty pranaams
* Challenges in life: 
I am currently facing....But by Your grace I will surpass it.
* Gratitude: I am so grateful to you that you have come in my life...
* From today onwards I will at least chat ___ rounds of 
Hare Krishna Mahamantra.
