Title : A Person or Formless Light

- SB 1.2.11
वदन्ति तत्तत्त्वविदस्तत्त्वं यज्ज्ञानमद्वयम् ।
ब्रह्मेति परमात्मेति भगवानिति शब्द्यते ॥ ११ ॥

Learned transcendentalists who know 
the Absolute Truth call this nondual 
substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān.
* Examples
> Train - Light, Engine & Coaches, People inside
> Sun - Light, Sun surface, inside sun demigod and people living on sun
> Mountain - Green color, Trees, Birds

- Pancho-pasna
* Worship anyone - Ganpati Ji, Durga Ji, Shiv Ji, 
Sun god, Vishnu Ji
* The all are same
* This is used for showing that God has form but 
is ultimately formless.

- BG 14.27
* Shastric References of Personhood
ब्रह्मणो हि प्रतिष्ठाहममृतस्याव्ययस्य च ।
शाश्वतस्य च धर्मस्य सुखस्यैकान्तिकस्य च ॥ २७ ॥

And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman,
which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and
is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.
* Fragerance of flower is formless, but flower has form.
* Sound is formless, but source has form.
* Source of formless entity is entity having form.
* Light of bulb formless, but bulb has form.
* Entity having less features, cannot be a source of
entity having more features.
* But entity having more features is the source of
entity having less features.
* Shri Krishna is sat-chit-ananda, He is lila-maya.
He has naam, rupa, guna, lila.
* Nirakar Brahm doesn't have rupa, lila. There are some
qualities - satya, eternal, nitya. But not all 
qualities of Shri Krishna.
* Krishna having 64 qualities, but other Vishnu tattva 
having 60 qualities. Extra 4 qualities are :-
> Venu-madhurya
> Rup-madhurya
> Prem-madhurya
> Lila-madhurya

- Isopanishad verse 15
hiraṇmayena pātreṇa
satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham
tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu
satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye

O my Lord, sustainer of all that lives, 
Your real face is covered by Your dazzling 
effulgence. Kindly remove that covering 
and exhibit Yourself to Your pure devotee.
* Person far away from God, then God only
make them see His effulgence.
* Person who are near to God, wants to do
service, wants to see God's beautiful form,
then God out of mercy shows His form.
