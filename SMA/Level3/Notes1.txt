Title : A Person or Formless Light

- SB 1.2.11
वदन्ति तत्तत्त्वविदस्तत्त्वं यज्ज्ञानमद्वयम् ।
ब्रह्मेति परमात्मेति भगवानिति शब्द्यते ॥ ११ ॥

Learned transcendentalists who know 
the Absolute Truth call this nondual 
substance Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān.
* Examples
> Train - Light, Engine & Coaches, People inside
> Sun - Light, Sun surface, inside sun demigod and people living on sun
> Mountain - Green color, Trees, Birds

- Pancho-pasna
* Worship anyone - Ganpati Ji, Durga Ji, Shiv Ji, 
Sun god, Vishnu Ji
* The all are same
* This is used for showing that God has form but 
is ultimately formless.

- BG 14.27
* Shastric References of Personhood
ब्रह्मणो हि प्रतिष्ठाहममृतस्याव्ययस्य च ।
शाश्वतस्य च धर्मस्य सुखस्यैकान्तिकस्य च ॥ २७ ॥

And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman,
which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and
is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.
* Fragerance of flower is formless, but flower has form.
* Sound is formless, but source has form.
* Source of formless entity is entity having form.
* Light of bulb formless, but bulb has form.
* Entity having less features, cannot be a source of
entity having more features.
* But entity having more features is the source of
entity having less features.
* Shri Krishna is sat-chit-ananda, He is lila-maya.
He has naam, rupa, guna, lila.
* Nirakar Brahm doesn't have rupa, lila. There are some
qualities - satya, eternal, nitya. But not all 
qualities of Shri Krishna.
* Krishna having 64 qualities, but other Vishnu tattva 
having 60 qualities. Extra 4 qualities are :-
> Venu-madhurya
> Rup-madhurya
> Prem-madhurya
> Lila-madhurya

- Isopanishad verse 15
hiraṇmayena pātreṇa
satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham
tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu
satya-dharmāya dṛṣṭaye

O my Lord, sustainer of all that lives, 
Your real face is covered by Your dazzling 
effulgence. Kindly remove that covering 
and exhibit Yourself to Your pure devotee.
* Person far away from God, then God only
make them see His effulgence.
* Person who are near to God, wants to do
service, wants to see God's beautiful form,
then God out of mercy shows His form.

- SB 5.12.11
ज्ञानं विशुद्धं परमार्थमेक-
मनन्तरं त्वबहिर्ब्रह्म सत्यम् ।
प्रत्यक् प्रशान्तं भगवच्छब्दसंज्ञं
यद्वासुदेवं कवयो वदन्ति ॥ ११ ॥

What, then, is the ultimate truth? The answer is that nondual 
knowledge is the ultimate truth. It is devoid of the contamination 
of material qualities. It gives us liberation. It is the one
without a second, all-pervading and beyond imagination. The 
first realization of that knowledge is Brahman. Then Paramātmā, 
the Supersoul, is realized by the yogīs who try to see Him 
without grievance. This is the second stage of realization. 
Finally, full realization of the same supreme knowledge is 
realized in the Supreme Person. All learned scholars describe
the Supreme Person as Vāsudeva, the cause of Brahman, Paramātmā and others.

- Artha-patti Nyaya
* Nyaya means logic
* Statement 1
> Rahul does not eat in the morning
* Statement 2
> Rahul is gaining weight due to overeating
* Logic :
> Rahul is eating at night.
* Similarly
> Statement 1
>> God does not have a feet, leg, hands 
or face
> Statement 2
>> God is having supremely beautiful
and merciful form
> Logic :
>> Lord is having a spiritual form
> As sharir means that which is prone to decay
> A-shariram means that which does not decay
>> As God's form never decay.

- 2 types of logic
* Sam-yog
> Agar koi chij addon ki jaati hai
> E.g. -> Putting a book on table
* Sam-vaaye
> A quality which is inherent to a object
> E.g. -> Whiteness in milk
* Jiva in material body comes under sam-yog
> As law of karma decides type of body, 
capability of senses and body.
* Body of God comes under sam-vaaye

- Lord Krishna : The source of Supersoul
- Parmatma : Super soul

- Sequence of knowledge
* Vedas 
> has - karm-kand, gyan-kand, upasna-kand etc
> ritualistic version
> No mention of bhagwan ki divyata
* Upanishad
> High knowledge
> Part of Veda
> Also known as Vedanta :

- Where impersonal philosophy is right?
* Material world is temporary and gives misery.
* One should acquire spiritual knowledge given
in the scriptures.
* Sense gratification is an impediment for self
realization.
* Purity of mind is required for meditation.
* One should do sadhna to purify one self.
* There is spiritual reality beyond this material world.

- Can a soul dissolve into formlessness?
* Akledya - soul is insoluble (BG 2.24)

- Can a soul become God after liberation?
* Avirakarya - soul remains soul (BG 2.25)

- Case studies - shifting from impersonalism to Bhakti
* The 4 Kumaras
> Nirakarvadio mai sarvshreshtha
> From Gyani Paramahams became Premi Paramahams
* Shrila Shukadev Goswami
> Became devotee after listening Shrimad Bhagavatam
