Title : Varna-Ashram Dharma (Part 2)
Ashrama - Spiritual Order in Society

- Consist of
* Brahmachari, Grihasth, Vanaprastha, Sannyasa

- Origin of Ashrams 
* SB 11.17.14
* गृहाश्रमो जघनतो ब्रह्मचर्यं हृदो मम ।
वक्ष:स्थलाद्वनेवास: संन्यास: शिरसि स्थित: ॥ १४ ॥

The married order of life appeared from the loins of 
My universal form, and the celibate students came from 
My heart. The forest-dwelling retired order of life 
appeared from My chest, and the renounced order of 
life was situated within the head of My universal form.

- 4 spiritual orders
* Brahmachari Life (25% life)
> One who works on level of Brahm.
> Each and every activity is for the Lord - Hearing, speaking,
walking, sleeping etc.
* Grihastha Life (25% life)
* Vanaprastha Life (25% life)
> Brahmacharya ashram revisited
* Sanyaas life (25% life)
* If a person is brahmachari life is able to fully understand
by hearing to the extent of realization.
> Can get into directly Sanyaas earlier.
* In grihastha life person learns by experience.

- Varna and Ashram only work together.
* Brahmana - Brahmchari (25% life), Grihastha (25% life),
Vanaprastha (25% life), Sanyaas (25% life)
> Person can take sannyas when have qualities like
>> Peaceful, austere, religious, god beleivers, tapasvi,
gyan ke prati unmukh
* Kshatriya - 25%, 25%, 50%
> Cannot take sannyas, as unable to teach, as teaching
requires tapasya and sadhna.
* Vaishya - 25%, 75%
* Shudra - Grihastha (100% life)
> Will not take Brahmchari life

- Duties of Brahmachari (SB 11.17.29)
* While engaged in serving the spiritual master one should 
remain as a humble servant, and thus when the guru is walking
the servant should humbly walk behind. When the guru lies
down to sleep, the servant should also lie down nearby, and
when the guru has awakened, the servant should sit near him,
massaging his lotus feet and rendering other, similar services.
When the guru is sitting down on his āsana, the servant should 
stand nearby with folded hands, awaiting the guru’s order. In 
this way one should always worship the spiritual master.
* Types of Brahmachari
> Savitre
Brahmachari for 3 days then continue normal life.
> Prajapate
Brahmachari for 1 year. 
> Brahm
Brahmachari till residing in Gurukul.
> Naisthik
Brahmachari for life from beginning till end of life.

strength, vigor, knowledge, wealth, undying fame, virtues
and devotion to the truth increase.

* CC Madhya 13.80
nāhaṁ vipro na ca nara-patir nāpi vaiśyo na śūdro
nāhaṁ varṇī na ca gṛha-patir no vanastho yatir vā
kintu prodyan-nikhila-paramānanda-pūrnāmṛtābdher
gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ

‘I am not a brāhmaṇa, I am not a kṣatriya, I am not a vaiśya
or a śūdra. Nor am I a brahmacārī, a householder, a vānaprastha
or a sannyāsī. I identify Myself only as the servant of the
servant of the servant of the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the
maintainer of the gopīs. He is like an ocean of nectar, and He is
the cause of universal transcendental bliss. He is always 
existing with brilliance.’
