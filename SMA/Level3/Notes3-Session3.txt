Title : Peace Formula

- How to get peace in unfavourable situations?

- BG 5.29
* भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम् ।
सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति ॥ २९ ॥

A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to
be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and 
demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of
all living entities, attains peace from the pangs
of material miseries.
* Reason for not being peaceful
> Due to seeing oneself as controller and proprietor.
> And when things go away, then all peace is gone.
* When we accept Krishna as owner of all things and oneself
then we will become peaceful instantly.
> Also doing everything for Krishna as goal.

- Peace Formula
* Understanding Krishna as controller of myself
* Ego and desires causes lack of peace.

- Peace - Rare commodity
* There will exist a thing in life, which is causing distress.
* There is no peace in heaven also.
* Material world is not a place for enjoyment,
but a place for rectification.
> If we do spiritual activities here, then can
experience happiness.

- Root cause of all the sufferings
* Just like for fish out of water, if we give all best food, 
entertainment, money etc. This will not give happiness to
fish. This fish will get happiness in water.
* Similarly soul is spiritual, soul cannot get happiness
in material world.
* Just like water becomes solid due to cold and loses its
flowing property. And becomes liquid by warmth.
* Similarly soul has property of doing service, but because
due to coming in this material world, the service attitude
has become into enjoying attitude. 
* Due to this soul is lacking peace.
* By warmth of Krishna consciousness and bhakti, soul gains
its original service attitude. And becomes happy.

- All that glitters is not gold
* Not everything in this world is meant for soul.
* Material world has form due to reflection of spiritual world.
* But without substance. Will not get enjoyment.
* Reflection gives idea of existence of original entity. 

- Watering the root and not the leaves
* Satisfying the source, Krishna, will satisfy all others, demigods
etc.
* Feeding stomach nourishes whole body.

- Cataract of agyan - agyan chakshu
* Cannot see as it is.
* Gyan chakshu is needed to see as it is.
* And will become chinta free.

- Our offering to God
* As much as employ things in service to God.
* This will give happiness to oneself.
* More we are detached
> More we become happy
> More we are able to contribute

- Allocated Quota
* We should take and use only our allocated quota
* E.g. : Grains on ground, and birds, animals will 
take only their allocated quota.
* Greed also makes one full of anxiety.

- Honey bee
* Honey bee over container of honey, cannot taste honey
being outside of container.
* Ritualistic worship cannot bring peace in one's life.
> Like trying to lick honey container from outside.
> Going mandir on particular day, breaking narial, jal chadana,
Suryadeva ko jal chadana for making life mangalmaya.
> Makes one hollow and shallow.
> Any difficulty in their life can break them easily
and make them athiest.
* One should take honey from inside, then will taste come.
* Add Bhajan to Puja-Archana.
* Will get peace of mind.
* BG 10.9
मच्च‍ित्ता मद्ग‍तप्राणा बोधयन्त: परस्परम् ।
कथयन्तश्च मां नित्यं तुष्यन्ति च रमन्ति च ॥ ९ ॥
* Great satisfaction and anand will come when we converse
about God. It brings content and spiritual substance to life.

- Conclusion
* Krishna is the Supreme Enjoyer, we are meant to be enjoyed.
* Understand Krishna to be the controller, and offer everything
to him. This makes us peaceful.
* Material world is place for rectification and not a place for
enjoyment. Dukh-aalaya.
* Only go by and use allocated quota. Not do lalach.
* Be honey seeker. Make spirituality our daily practice.
