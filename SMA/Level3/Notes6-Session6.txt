Title : Varna-Ashram Dharma (Part 1)

- What is Varnashram System
* Varna - Social order in Society
[Bhraman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra]
* Ashram - Spiritual order in Society
[Bhramachari, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sannyasa]

* Learning becomes better
* People are happier in general
* Closer to nature
*  Ease in practicing Bhakti

- Varna System is not caste system.
* Varna System got distorted into caste system in
Kali-yuga by so-called brahmans, who doesn't 
have brahmical qualities. Due to Kali-yug, brahman
lost their power and qualities.

- Originally only one (SB 11.17.10)
* In satyuga there were only one social class that is 
hams or paramham.
* All people are unalloyed devotees of the Lord from birth.
* Leaned scholars call this firs tage Krta-yuga, or the age
in which all religious duties are perfectly fulfilled.

- Varna - Occupational duties
* Lower quality start coming in Treta-yuga, now we need
Varna.
* BG 4.13
चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः ।
तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ॥ १३ ॥ 

According to the three modes of material nature and the 
work associated with them, the four divisions of human
society are created by Me. And although I am the creator
of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer,
being unchangeable.
* Varna is decided by nature and guna of a person.
* Person examples, where birth haven't decided their Varna.
> Shri Vedvyas Ji - son of fisher woman (Satyavati Ji)
> Shri Gautam Rishi - came from female rabit
> Shri Jambuk Rishi - came from jackal
> Shri Valmiki Rishi - came from anthill
> Shri Rishi Shringi Ji (In Ramayan) - came from female deer
> Shri Kaushik Rishi - came from Kusha Grass
> Shri Vashist Muni Ji - son of heavenly damsel (Urvashi Ji)

- The Origin of all Varnas 
* SB 11.17.13
* In Tretā-yuga the four social orders were manifested from
the universal form of the Personality of Godhead. The brāhmaṇas 
appeared from the Lord’s face, the kṣatriyas from the Lord’s arms, 
the vaiśyas from the Lord’s thighs and the śūdras from the legs of 
that mighty form. Each social division was recognized by its 
particular duties and behavior.

- 3 Modes and Professions
* Goodness (satoguna) -> Brahman -> The priestly or educators class
> Depend upon charity (daan).
* Passion (rajoguna) -> Kshatirya -> Administrative class
> Depend upon taxes (kar).
* Passion+ignorance (rajoguna+tamoguna) -> Vaishya -> The business
class
> Depend upon profit (laabh).
* Ignorance (tamoguna) -> Shudra -> The executors class
> Depend upon salary (kamai).

- Who is Brahmana? (BG 18.42)
* शमो दमस्तप: शौचं क्षान्तिरार्जवमेव च ।
ज्ञानं विज्ञानमास्तिक्यं ब्रह्मकर्म स्वभावजम् ॥ ४२ ॥

Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, 
honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness – these 
are the natural qualities by which the brāhmaṇas work.

- Who is Kshatriya? (BG 18.43)
* शौर्यं तेजो धृतिर्दाक्ष्यं युद्धे चाप्यपलायनम् ।
दानमीश्वरभावश्च क्षात्रं कर्म स्वभावजम् ॥ ४३ ॥

Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage
in battle, generosity and leadership are the natural 
qualities of work for the kṣatriyas.

- Who is a Vaishya and Shudra? (BG 18.44)
* कृषिगोरक्ष्यवाणिज्यं वैश्यकर्म स्वभावजम् ।
परिचर्यात्मकं कर्म श‍ूद्रस्यापि स्वभावजम् ॥ ४४ ॥

Farming, cow protection and business are the natural
work for the vaiśyas, and for the śūdras there are labor
and service to others.

- Diksha - Makes the person brahmana
* All people are shudra by birth.
* They can become brahman, kshatriya, vaishya by 
diksha
* Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva 142.46
yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ
tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām

As bell metal is turned to gold when mixed with mercury
in an alchemical process, so one who is properly trained
and initiated by a bona fide spiritual master immediately
becomes a brāhmaṇa.

- Vaishnava is never a shudra (Padma Purana, Uttar Khanda 39)
* Vishnora ayam yato hyasit tasmaad Viashnava uchyate
Sarvesham chaiva varnanam Vaishnava shrshtha uchyate

One who is related to Vishnu through devotion is known as a 
Vaishnava. A genuine Vaishnava is superior to all the varnas
and is the best of all.
* Vaishnav may be working according to his nature as - brahaman,
ksatriya, vaishya, shudra.
> But there activity are said to be divya.
> As they are devotees of the lord.
> So they are beyond varna.
* Definition of Brahman is - one who knows Brahm.
* But Vaishnav knows Parabrahm - Krishna. From whom Brahm is
emanating.
* So Vaishnav are srestha than Brahman.
