- Who is dearest to the lord
* BG 6.47
योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्ग‍तेनान्तरात्मना ।
श्रद्धावान्भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मत: ॥ ४७ ॥

And of all yogīs, the one with great faith 
who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within
himself and renders transcendental loving 
service to Me – he is the most intimately united 
with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. 
That is My opinion.

* To control the mind.
> Activities changes mano-bhav, chetna and 
sanskar in chitta.
* Externals effect the internals.
> In externals are senses.
> If we employ externals in sewa, then bhavna
arises that I should serve the Lord.
