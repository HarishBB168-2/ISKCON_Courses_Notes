Title : Importance of Service in Krishna Consciousness

-
* Nirakar vaadi is missing one important thing and that
is sewa.
* No one in this world is free from doing sewa.
Has to do sewa of
> Senses - fullfilling desires of senses.
> Family - working for family and their desires.
> Dog pet

- Soul's inherent nature (dharma) is to do sewa

- Love not expressed is not love
* Sewa is a way of expression.
* Both - being spiritual and not being religious - is 
not possible.
> It is like saying that I have feelings but I 
don't express them.
> Love not expressed is not love.
* Divine feelings in heart is called spirituality.
* Spirituality is expressed by rituals
> Going to mandir.
> Flower and bhoga arpit karna.
> Doing prayers.
* Being ritualistic is when
> Having no feelings and expressing (doing rituals).
> This is dry.
* Way of expression may be different in different
religions.

- Who is dearest to the lord
* BG 6.47
योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्ग‍तेनान्तरात्मना ।
श्रद्धावान्भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मत: ॥ ४७ ॥

And of all yogīs, the one with great faith 
who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within
himself and renders transcendental loving 
service to Me – he is the most intimately united 
with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. 
That is My opinion.

- Benefit of doing service
* Engaging senses pulls the mind ultimately.
* To control the mind.
> Activities changes mano-bhav, chetna and 
sanskar in chitta.
* Externals effect the internals.
> In externals are senses.
> If we employ externals in sewa, then bhavna
arises that I should serve the Lord.
* BG 18.65
> Start doing namaskar, then will do puja.
> Puja will make him bhakt.
> After being bhakt, then mind will 
also fix on Krishna.
* To engange mind, one needs to engage
physically.
* By sewa we are employing psycophysical
nature in sewa
> Academic nature - reading, understanding,
telling other people.
> Physical nature - cleaning, moving items.
* By sewa person starts going beyond
psycophysical nature.
* Ego -> also goes by doing sewa.
> Sewa karte wakt pasina nikalta hai. Uss
pasine ke sath ahankar bhi nikalta hai.
> Also by feedback and corrections.

- Shri Ram Ji asking to Hanuman Ji and Vanar sena
* Why am I making you build this bridge?
* Ans1 : For going to Lanka.
> But I can dry the whole ocean with one arrow.
* Ans2 : To kill Ravan.
> But I am inside heart of Ravan, and I can kill
him destorying his heart.
* All people asked :
> They why are you making us build this bridge?
* Shri Ram Ji said :
> To employ you all in the service/sewa.
> To give you kripa.

- As child giving pen as gift to Father by
buying it from his pocket money.
* This pocket money was received by Father.
* But father becomes happy by this action of
child.
* Similarty Bhagwan becomes happy, when we
do sewa.

- By doing sewa
* We can go beyond mood swings.
* As we need to do sewa, irrespective of
mood.
* Mood swings are due to rajoguna (mode of passion)

- Attitude of doing sewa
* For pleasure of the Lord.
* Example : Hanuman Ji with sindoor
> One time Mata Sita Ji was applying sindoor.
> Hanuman Ji was watching Mata Sita Ji.
> Hanuman Ji asked what is this you applying.
> Mata Sita Ji said this is called sindoor.
> Hanuman Ji asked why are you applying this sindoor.
> Mata Sita Ji said that this pleases Shri Ram Ji.
> Then hearing this Hanuman Ji went to market, and
searched for best sindoor. Asked from a peron about
it.
> Person said that this bag of sindoor is best.
> Then Hanuman Ji spread sindoor over his whole body.
> And came to Raaj sabha in Ayodhya.
> After seeing Hanuman Ji, Shri Ram Ji said what 
has happened to you.
> Hanuman Ji said that he went to meet Mata Sita Ji,
she was applying sindoor. And I asked what is this 
and why are you applying it. Mata Sita Ji said that
this is sindoor, and applying it pleases Shri Ram Ji.
Then I thought applying little sindoor on head 
pleases Shri Ram ji, then if I apply sindoor on my 
whole body, then this will please you more.
* Sewa attitude should be
> Exclusive focus on the Lord's pleasure
> Not caring pleasure of oneself.
> Result will be : bhakt will also get pleasure
by mercy of the Lord.
* Victory or defeat doesn't matter in sewa.
* Doing and engaging in sewa is important.

- How to do sewa.
* By minds, action, words
* Action
> Money
> Physical
* Words
> Spreading the good news
> Using people connections
* Mind
> Just like when Shri Vasudeva Ji was in jail and
want to donate cows as celeberation of Krishna's
birthday. But was unable to donate.
> So, he donated in his mind.

- 2 kinds of Devotional Service
* Service to Krishna
* Service to Krishna's devotees
* Doing both is required.
* Result is
> Entering Shri Golok Vrindavan.
> Seeing Lord Shri Krishna.
> Get personal association of Lord Shri Krishna.
> Get embraced by Lord Shri Krishna.
> Get Adhyatmik sharir, nature of this body
is to do sewa.
> Get personal service to Lord Shri Krishna.
