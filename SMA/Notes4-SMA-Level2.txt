Title : Social Work Vs Krishna Consciousness

- Solution for a lost crying child
* Ignore the child : bad solution
* Give chocolate to child : incomplete solution
> As child will stop crying for some time
> But not permanently
> Only physical well being
* Bring child to parents : right solution
> Both physical and spiritual well being

- Solution types
* Temporary
> Clearasil for pimples
* Permanent
> SAFI for pimples

- Moral Education
* Ethics, Values, equality, truth, etiquette, etc.
* Does not lead to transformation of heart.
* Unable to correct bad habits and sanskar.
* Moral education without spirituality is like beautified 
and make up done dead body.
* It has no life into it
* It is so dry
* It is so theoretical

- Common Father hood - Before Brother hood
* Without common father hood, there can't be brother hood.

- Guided Missiles Misguided Men
* Tech like internet -> but misused by misguided men
* Skill deveopment -> people will misuse it 
> E.g. - for making bombs

- Real help?
* Social help is like, feeding pakode to a person with
jaundice (where pakode is prevented), making disease more
bad.
> Increases materialism in people, by facilitating their sense
enjoyment, without any connection to God.
* Real help
> Distributing books
> Doing rath yatra
* Family that
> Dines together, shines together
> Prays together, stays together
> Sings together, clings together
> Dances together, advances together

- Comparison: Ayodhya and Lanka
* Lanka made of Gold; Ayodhya is not.
* Ayodhya is a thirth place: Lanka is not.
* Ayodhya means - aa : no external person can, 
yodhya : fight with warriors here
> Inner meaning : no fight between people of Ayodhya,
as Lord Hari is center of existence of people.
* So in a society if God becomes centre, there would be
> cooperation, forgiveness, accomodating each other
* In Lanka, there is selfishness, living for oneself,
> Everybody has their ego as center of existence.
> Person is treated lika a thing.
* In Ayodhya, everyone and everything is respected.

- Transformation case study of the Hippies
* Because Krishna was made center.
* By giving them
> Krishna Prasadam
> Hare Krishna Mantra
> Teachings of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita
* Values comes from spirituality
