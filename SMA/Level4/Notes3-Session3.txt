Title : Surpassing Maya

- Why Tussle with Maya?
* Makes journey of bhakti more adventurous

> We can surpass maya only when we are 100% surrendered.
* Humbling experience
* We become desperate
* We become prayerful

* Chanting

- Watchful of Bad Association
* As this creates desires in oneself.
* Bad Association can come from anywhere
mobile, internet, friends, collegues, newspaper etc.
* Regularly take good and saintly association.
* Srila Prabhupada's last instruction
* Always avoid mode of passion and ignorance.
stay in good association and saintly association.

- Kshatriya Spirit
* Bring feeling that I have to fight with maya till death.
* With sword of mercy.
* We get sword of mercy when there is willingness.
* Srila Prabhupada Ji is saying in Shri Chaitanya Charitamrit.
If somebody is not determined, then not even God can save somebody
from maya.
* Maintain this Kshatriya spirit.

- We lose the way by contemplation
* By contemplating about an object we become attached to it.
* Then comes desire to enjoy that object.
* First we lose the war in head by contemplation.
* We should not contemplate on sense objects.

- Creating favorable environment
* As beginner in bhakti, external environment effects our
internal environment.
* Creating a holy space for yourself.
In home etc. Putting quotes in room and around us, putting pictures.

- Educating the mind with divine knowledge.
* Not educated by mind, but educate the mind.
* By reading shashtra and hearing devotees.
* Acquiring more knowledge
> Bhagawan ke prati aur prerna deti hai.
> Santosh milta hai.
> Icchaye shant hoti hai.
> Become more humble.
* Spend more time educating the mind, than educating the world.
* Mind without divine knowledge is biggest enemy.

- Offering Prayers
* One way is to sing Vaishnav Acharya songs.
* 2nd way is in your own words also.

- Creating new Sanskars
* They are like the grooves on surface of the mind.
* Ye bahut mehnat ka kaam hai.
