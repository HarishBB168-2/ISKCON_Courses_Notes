* Do your best and leave the rest
* BG 2.47
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥ ४७ ॥

- Motivation for work
* Previously motivation came from result and
ambition.
* Now motivation will come by love towards Lord.
> Working for Lord.

- Srila Prabhupada Ji faced failures from 1922 to 1965
* Facing 43 years of failures.

- Man proposes God disposes
* Higher version : God proposes devotee executes.

- Do "Your" Best
* With no sense of doer ship.
> Doing as 100% depends upon our efforts.
> Praying as 100% depends upon God.
* Having goal is required.
> Goal is different from result.
> Goal is set before work.
> Result is received after action.
> Don't be attached to result.
> Goal makes direction clear.
* You will be cool.

- Leave the Rest
* God has the ultimate control.
> Accept this fact.
* He maintains ultimately.

- Doer ship
* God -> Nature -> Soul
* God : Approver (Updrasta and Anumanta)
* Nature : Facilitator, Law of Karma
* Soul : Desirer

- Due to "I am the Doer"
* Unhealthy Competition

- In bhakti effort matters instead of result
* Example : Shri Jatayu Ji and Shri Arjun Ji.

- Poem
Title : God's plan only He knows!

I asked for strength and God gave me
difficulties to make me strong.

I asked for wisdom and God gave me problems
to solve.

I asked for prosperity and God gave me 
brawn and brain to work.

I asked for courage and God gave me dangers
to overcome.

I asked for patience and God placed me in
situations where I was forced to wait.

I asked for love and God gave me troubled
people to help.

I asked for favors and God gave me opportunities.

I asked for everything so I could enjoy life.
Instead, He gave me life, so I could enjoy
everything.

I received nothing I wanted...I recieved 
everything I needed.

My prayer has been answered.
