* SB 2.9.34
ऋतेऽर्थं यत् प्रतीयेत न प्रतीयेत चात्मनि ।
तद्विद्यादात्मनो मायां यथाभासो यथा तम: ॥ ३४ ॥

O Brahmā, whatever appears to be of any value, 
if it is without relation to Me, has no reality.
Know it as My illusory energy, that reflection 
which appears to be in darkness.
* Maya and Bhagwan
> Darkness appears where is one person's shadow.
> Maya is shadow of Bhagwan.
>> As shadow works like - as one person moves hand, so 
the shadow also moves.
>> Maya works as Bhagwan desires.
> As shadow cannot cover the person, whose shadow it is.
>> So the Maya cannot cover the Maya.
>> But shadow can cover small ants.
>> Similarly Maya can cover jiva.
> Shadow has no relation with the person.
>> Similarly Maya has no relation with Bhagwan.
* Two divisions
> Jiva Maya (Avarnatmika Shakti) (Covering potency)
>> That which causes ignorance.
>> Covers identity of jiva.
>> Example - Bhoot chada hua vyakti apne aap ko kuch aur
manta hai.
> Guna Maya (Prakshepatmika/Viskheptamika Shakti)
(Distracting potency)
>> Activities in world based on covered identity.
>> Example - activity of a drunk person.

- Guna-Maya Further Explained
* SB 3.20.18
> Shri Brahma Ji created from his shadow the coverings of ignorance
of the conditioned souls.
* 5 coverings of ignorance
> Tamisra (aversion)
>> Aversion towards Bhagwan.
> Andha-tamisra (tenacity of bodily existence)
>> Identifying with the body.
> Tamas (ignorance)
>> Covering the gyan
> Moha (ego)
>> I am the body. And people and things associated with this body are
mine.
> Maha-moha (seeking enjoyment through the body)
>> I will do bhoga through this body.
