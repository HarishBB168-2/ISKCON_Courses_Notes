ऋतेऽर्थं यत् प्रतीयेत न प्रतीयेत चात्मनि ।
तद्विद्यादात्मनो मायां यथाभासो यथा तम: ॥ ३४ ॥

O Brahmā, whatever appears to be of any value, 
if it is without relation to Me, has no reality.
Know it as My illusory energy, that reflection 
which appears to be in darkness.
* 
> Darkness appears where is one person's shadow.
