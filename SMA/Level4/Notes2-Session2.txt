Title : Understanding Maya

- Vastu (existence)
* Vastava Vastu
Spiritual existence
Similar to Bhagawan
* Avastava Vastu
Not similar to Bhagwan
Material Energy
> Real but temporary - Maya
> Non existent (e.g. - flower blossoming in air)

- Maya has two divisions
* SB 2.9.34
ऋतेऽर्थं यत् प्रतीयेत न प्रतीयेत चात्मनि ।
तद्विद्यादात्मनो मायां यथाभासो यथा तम: ॥ ३४ ॥

O Brahmā, whatever appears to be of any value, 
if it is without relation to Me, has no reality.
Know it as My illusory energy, that reflection 
which appears to be in darkness.
* Maya and Bhagwan
> Darkness appears where is one person's shadow.
> Maya is shadow of Bhagwan.
>> As shadow works like - as one person moves hand, so 
the shadow also moves.
>> Maya works as Bhagwan desires.
> As shadow cannot cover the person, whose shadow it is.
>> So the Maya cannot cover the Maya.
>> But shadow can cover small ants.
>> Similarly Maya can cover jiva.
> Shadow has no relation with the person.
>> Similarly Maya has no relation with Bhagwan.
* Two divisions
> Jiva Maya (Avarnatmika Shakti) (Covering potency)
>> That which causes ignorance.
>> Covers identity of jiva.
>> Example - Bhoot chada hua vyakti apne aap ko kuch aur
manta hai.
> Guna Maya (Prakshepatmika/Viskheptamika Shakti)
(Distracting potency)
>> Activities in world based on covered identity.
>> Example - activity of a drunk person.

- Guna-Maya Further Explained
* SB 3.20.18
> Shri Brahma Ji created from his shadow the coverings of ignorance
of the conditioned souls.
* 5 coverings of ignorance
> Tamisra (aversion)
>> Aversion towards Bhagwan.
> Andha-tamisra (tenacity of bodily existence)
>> Identifying with the body.
> Tamas (ignorance)
>> Covering the gyan
> Moha (ego)
>> I am the body. And people and things associated with this body are
mine.
> Maha-moha (seeking enjoyment through the body)
>> I will do bhoga through this body.

- 
* Bhagawan is beyond liberation and conditioned states.
* Maya is shy of the Lord
SB 2.5.12-13
> Being ashamed of her position.
>> Due the work of distancing jivatama from Bhagawan. 
> Person bewildered by her.
Always talk nonsense and absorbed in thoughts of "It is I" and
"It is mine."
* Maya is activated by the Lord.
> Bhagawan activates maya though the Yog-maya.
>> Similar to magnet influencing iron, through magnetic field.
> Bhagawan activates by glance.
> Personification of material nature Shrimati Durga Mata is conscious,
but material nature is not conscious and is inert matter.

- We may deduce
* Maya is activated by Bhagawan
* Maya does not exist within Bhagawan
* Maya does not exist without Bhagawan
* Maya exist outside Bhagawan
* Maya is perceived when Bhagawan is not perceived
> When we become vimukh by consciousness and attitude.

- Maya is real but bondage is unreal
* SB 11.11.1
* Become conditioned/bonded :- when soul moves eyes from Bhagawan
and takes absorption in material energy. Then soul is considered
to be conditioned, this is due to soul's thoughts are without Bhagawan.
* Unable to move towards Bhagawan : As very low spiritual energy, and 
soul is seeking pleasure in material energy.

- Jiva's Bondage is not real
* SB 3.7.10
Like a man who dreams that he sees his head cut off.
* Sadhna Bhakti - Wakes us up from Maha-maya to Yoga-maya

- Which is not product of Maya
* Ichha shakti - most inherent quality of soul
> Similar to hotness is inherent quality of fire.
* Gyan shakti - due to iccha shakti one can get gyan.
* Kriya shakti - due to iccha shakti one can do action.
* Gyan and Kriya shakti also are inherent to soul.
* Soul wakes up when these 3 shakti are active and are used for
Bhagawan.
* These shakti works as
Gyan >> Iccha >> Kriya
> Taking gyan, iccha increases, and does kriya accordingly
* These shakti can be covered by maya, when they are vimukh
from bhagawan. And can become cause of liberation when are
towards bhagawan.

- Graphical example by Srila Jiva Goswami
* Scene - A lake with water and air blowing, and air blowing causing
ripples in water.
* Lake - Physical body
* Water - Psychic body (subtle body)
* Wind - Sense objects
* Ripples - Emotional roller coaster

- Maya conforms to the Lila of the Lord
* SB 7.1.8
When the quality of goodness is prominent, the sages and demigods
flourish with the help of that quality, with which they are infused
and surcharged by the Supreme Lord. Similarly, when the mode of
passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when ignorance is 
prominent the Yakṣas and Rākṣasas flourish. The Supreme Personality of Godhead
is present in everyone’s heart, fostering the reactions of sattva-guṇa,
rajo-guṇa and tamo-guṇa.

- But how? There we go...
* SB 10.3.26
* Material energy works under the control of powerful time.
* Time act as catalyst for maya to conform to the Lila of the Lord.
* In material world there is - past, present and future.
> Everything detriorates
* In spiritual world there is only present.
> Facilitates lila, anand and relation with the Lord.
