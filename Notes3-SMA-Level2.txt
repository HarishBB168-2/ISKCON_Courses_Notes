Title : Answering GK for PK and Oh my God

- Before We Begin
* Do we really need a session on a movie?
Yes, as they became means to transform cultures instead as a source of
entertainment
* Has the movie brought insecurity among the religionist?
No, as mandir, math etc can arrange their maintenance easily
* Is PK an anti Hindu movie?
> Yes, as very minute mention of other religions

- Many Goods highlighted by the movie
* PK as a character is not offensive in mentality (but innocently ignorant)
* Fraudulent teachers exposed
> Movie should expose what is truth as well as what is not truth
* Ritualistic approach of people
* God is beyond all worldly boundaries of religion
* People attached to godmen instead of God.
* The movie is theistic in overall approach

- Why waste milk on God's image when his children are starving?
* Abhishek from milk etc items is made into charnamrit and spread to all people. And not dumped into drain as shown in movie.
* Money wasted by society
> Movie tickets (1000 rs per person)
> Flying shampane in parties
> Money spent on space explorations
* Not any part of profit made from such movies was donated into society causes.

- If God can hear our prayers directly why do we need to pray to a murti?
* Prayer is always done to a person.
* We cannot see forms of God : God in Kingdom, Cosmic expansions, 
parmatma, Incarnations
* Accessible form : Vigraha
> God is omnipresent, everywhere, even in vigraha
> Christians and Muslims also do deity worship directly or indirectly
>> Cross and chaddar chadana

- Are different religions like different companies with their gods are their
product. Rituals are wrong numbers?
* Rituals convey certain message
* Rituals may be different but spirit is same
> Like different praying methods in religions, but purpose is same

- How can God who is unlimited appear as a limited stone image?
* God has all powers, as well as power for appearing in vigraha

- Jo Dar gaya wo Mandir gaya???
* Types of people coming to Mandir
> Fearful
> Out of duty
> Desires
> Out of Love

- Does God Like Flattery?
* God doesn't need flattery
* God has infinite no of devotees, praising and serving God.
* Even if God is aptakaam, God is satisfied if no one is prainsing
and serving Him.
* Person gets purified when he praises God.

- Are there two gods - the god who made us and the god 
whom we made?
* Narad panchratra - used by Dhruv maharaj
> Deity worship is for Dwaparyuga
* Murti puja is wrong
> Common person (political, actor etc) statue worshiping
* Vigraha are not symbols, but actually god

- Why does God favor the wealthy by letting them bypass the
queues in temples?
* VIP person needs safety and for proper management.
* If someone is giving for prasadam and arrangement, then there is
no wrong giving them VIP treatment. Just like at home serving guest 
in special utensils.
* Person in queue (poor) has time to give
* VIP person has money to give
* God give equal mercy to both VIP and common person

- When God is all-powerful, why do relgionists need to protect him?
* When devotee protects God, this is a way to express love.

- Why does God not answer our prayers?
* People has faith in God's power, but not on God's intelligence
* God has some better plan.

- Do we need middle men to approach God?
* Teacher is always needed to show the path
* GPS is needed to find quickest path.
* Even Milkha Singh needed teacher for 400 M race
* Kripa (from guru) needed to connect person in misery to God.
* Pramanik Guru is the way to God.

- Is religion meant to teach "love of God" or "fear of God"?
* In the beginning "fear of God" is needed.
* Ultimately love is motivating factor.

- We don't chant "Papa Papa" if I want a chocolate from my father,
so why should we chant "Krishna, Krishna" in case I want some thing?
* Chant names out of love
* Chanting is to revive our love
* For wanting something chanting is not needed, can directly ask.

- Why we should we offer "hair" a dirty part of our body to Balaji?
And these hair are sold, "kya shraddha kaa dhanda nahee hai ye?"
* Ritual is - O Lord for us external beauty is secondary and internal 
beauty is primary.
* Sacrificing outer beauty for internal beauty

- Does not institutionalization of religion kills its spirit?
* Institution maintain rules and regulations to reach God, just like river bed 
maintain river flow and reach to sea.
* Spiritual emotions are guided and routed toward Krishna.
* Facilitates geniuine feelings of spirituality

- When the God is in my heart then do I really need Guru?
* It is difficult to discriminate voice from inside (God or mind)
* So, guru is needed

- At end the Kanjibhai throws the key chain of Krishna as idolatry?
* It is like throwing prasadam.
* It is foolishness
