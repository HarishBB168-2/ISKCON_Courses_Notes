Title : Answering GK for PK and Oh my God

- Before We Begin

Yes, as they became means to transform cultures instead as a source of
entertainment

No, as mandir, math etc can arrange their maintenance easily
* Is PK an anti Hindu movie?
> Yes, as very minute mention of other religions

- Many Goods highlighted by the movie
* PK as a character is not offensive in mentality (but innocently ignorant)
* Fraudulent teachers exposed
> Movie should expose what is truth as well as what is not truth
* Ritualistic approach of people
* God is beyond all worldly boundaries of religion
* People attached to godmen instead of God.
* The movie is theistic in overall approach

- Why waste milk on God's image when his children are starving?
* Abhishek from milk etc items is made into charnamrit and spread to all people. And not dumped into drain as shown in movie.
* Money wasted by society
> Movie tickets (1000 rs per person)
> Flying shampane in parties
> Money spent on space explorations
* Not any part of profit made from such movies was donated into society causes.

- If God can hear our prayers directly why do we need to pray to a murti?
* Prayer is always done to a person.
* We cannot see forms of God : God in Kingdom, Cosmic expansions, 
parmatma, Incarnations
* Accessible form : Vigraha
> God is omnipresent, everywhere, even in vigraha
> Christians and Muslims also do deity worship directly or indirectly
>> Cross and chaddar chadana

- Are different religions like different companies with their gods are their
product. Rituals are wrong numbers?
* Rituals convey certain message
* Rituals may be different but spirit is same
> Like different praying methods in religions, but purpose is same

- How can God who is unlimited appear as a limited stone image?
* God has all powers, as well as power for appearing in vigraha

* Types of people coming to Mandir
> Fearful
> Out of duty
> Desires
> Out of Love

- Does God Like Flattery?
* God doesn't need flattery
* God has infinite no of devotees, praising and serving God.
* Even if God is aptakaam, God is satisfied if no one is prainsing
and serving Him.
* Person gets purified when he praises God.

- Are there two gods - the god who made us and the god 
whom we made?
* Narad panchratra - used by Dhruv maharaj
> Deity worship is for Dwaparyuga
* Murti puja is wrong
> Common person (political, actor etc) statue worshiping
* Vigraha are not symbols, but actually god

- Why does God favor the wealthy by letting them bypass the
queues in temples?
* VIP person needs safety and for proper management.
* If someone is giving for prasadam and arrangement, then there is
no wrong giving them VIP treatment. Just like at home serving guest 
in special utensils.
* Person in queue (poor) has time to give
* VIP person has money to give
* God give equal mercy to both VIP and common person

- When God is all-powerful, why do relgionists need to protect him?
* When devotee protects God, this is a way to express love.

- Why does God not answer our prayers?
* People has faith in God's power, but not on God's intelligence
* God has some better plan.

- Do we need middle men to approach God?
* Teacher is always needed to show the path
* GPS is needed to find quickest path.
* Even Milkha Singh needed teacher for 400 M race
* Kripa (from guru) needed to connect person in misery to God.
* Pramanik Guru is the way to God.

- Is religion meant to teach "love of God" or "fear of God"?
* In the beginning "fear of God" is needed.
* Ultimately love is motivating factor.

- We don't chant "Papa Papa" if I want a chocolate from my father,
so why should we chant "Krishna, Krishna" in case I want some thing?
* Chant names out of love
* Chanting is to revive our love
* For wanting something chanting is not needed, can directly ask.

- Why we should we offer "hair" a dirty part of our body to Balaji?
And these hair are sold, "kya shraddha kaa dhanda nahee hai ye?"
* Ritual is - O Lord for us external beauty is secondary and internal 
beauty is primary.
* Sacrificing outer beauty for internal beauty

- Does not institutionalization of religion kills its spirit?
* Institution maintain rules and regulations to reach God, just like river bed 
maintain river flow and reach to sea.
* Spiritual emotions are guided and routed toward Krishna.
* Facilitates geniuine feelings of spirituality

- When the God is in my heart then do I really need Guru?
* It is difficult to discriminate voice from inside (God or mind)
* So, guru is needed

- At end the Kanjibhai throws the key chain of Krishna as idolatry?
* It is like throwing prasadam.
* It is foolishness

- What is obstacle for taking bhakti in young age?
* Desires remain young
* Shloka by Shri Shankaracharya Ji
अङ्गं गलितं पलितं मुण्डं दशनविहीनं जातं तुण्डम् ।
वृद्धो याति गृहीत्वा दण्डं तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशापिण्डम् ॥

Anga gal gaye he, baal jhad gaye he, daat gir chuke he.
Walks with help of stick, but not gives up desires and hopes.
* Shloka by Shri Shankaracharya Ji
बालस्तावत् क्रीडासक्तः,तरुणस्तावत् तरुणीसक्तः।
वृद्धस्तावच्चिन्तासक्तः, परे ब्रह्मणि कोऽपि न सक्तः ॥

Balak khel kud me asakt hota he, tarun taruni me asakt hota he.
Budhapa chinta me nikalta he, koi Parabrahm ki jigyasa nahi karta he.

- Why to do Bhakti in young age?
* Habits can be changed in young age.
* Death can come at any moment.
* With old age learning goes down.
* We should offer ourselves when we are fresh.

- QNA Session
* When we try to preach to non devotees and friends they insult and make
fun of us. How to deal with these situations?
> They make fun of us, because they know if they don't make fun of us, then
they will also become like us, and they will not be able to enjoy things as
there are currently enjoying. They want to see us offended and awkward. 
So, best form of defense is to attack.
* Best form of argument is reasoning
> Example : 
Elderly person : Kya mala jap karte ho? Karmyogi bano.
Me : Accha karmyogi ke definition kya hoti he.
Elderly person : hmmm...... Jo apni jimmedari nibhata he ache se.
Me : To fir karmyogi aur karmi me kya antar he? Karmi bhi apni
jimmedari ache se nibhata he - family, house, children etc.
To karmyogi aur karmi me antar kya he?
Elderly person : <silent>
Me : In BG karmyoga is in 3rd chapter. Then gyanyoga, and then 
ashtangyoga. At last climax is bhaktiyoga. Then why are you saying 
for karmyoga.
* If somebody ask why you ar so spiritual, then whats the right ans. we can
deliver, so that he got satisfaction and he also come in spirituality?
> Every country has pride in their speciality.
> In our country nobody comes to learn fashion, technology etc.
> In our country people come to learn spirituality.
> I am born in india, and that's my speciality. And I am happy.
> No spiritual person has done suicided anywhere.
> Also in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self actualization is a need.
* How to know that our bhakit is reaching the Lord?
> If devotees are happy with you then bhakti is reaching Krishna
> Also you are becoming happier by practicing bhakti and you are feeling
spiritual joy, then bhakti is reaching Krishna.
* When Lord is everywhere, in the flower and in vigraha, then you are
offering God to God. What should i ans him?
> Flower is also energy of God, also God is residing in every particle (of 
flower also).
> When we offer in such a way, it benefits us?
> Just like people go in Ganga ji, and take water in their hands, and again
arpit to Ganga ji with reciting "Om Gangaye Namaha", as it benefits us.
> To train ourselves, by doing offering to The Lord. To express our love for
God.
* Agar ek baar bhi Bhagawan ka naam lelo to saare paap nasht ho jaata hai.
Jaise abhi Yogini Ekadashi aayie the aur usme bhi yahi kaha jata hai ki is 
Ekadashi ka vrat karne se saare paapon ka naash hota hai. Then why people
do same practice daily & again & again if it works same by doing one time?
> Fructified karma are not destroyed, unfructified karma are destroyed by
doing Ekadashi.
> We are also regularly collecting unfructified karma, so we should do
Ekadashi vrat regularly.
> If we do Bhakti nicely and effectively with Ekadashi vrat, 
then fructified karma will also start diluting.
> Paap se mukta hone is a side effect, main goal is to increase attraction
towards Bhagawan.
* A person who has practiced bhakti whole of his life, did his learning 
capacity also goes down in old age?
> His learning capacity remains same.
> He has kept his learning aptitude young by doing bhakti, and has given
higher taste of bhakti to the aptitude.
* How to develop good habits?
> By cultivating good habits, by coming to ritual platform.
> Think big start small, start doing small steps.
> Learn bearing the tasteless struggle of this process.
* How to increase interest of youth in spirituality?
> Some person does some work, when he sees some advantages in it.
> We have to bring out advantages of spirituality.
> Youth attract towards role models. We should also have spiritual
role models.
>> Example: HH Radhanath Swami Maharaj.
> We should also give scientific explanation of spirituality.
* Change our bad habits.
> Overthinking solved by :
Practical engagement, simplicity in life, disconnection of over download 
of data from social media.
> Low tolerance level solved by :
By knowing that everything/everyone takes its/there own time. 
Difficult time which you are facing, will know that this is my own karma
and I have to tolerate it. There is no solution in anger and sadness.
> Laziness solved by :
Healthy eating, associating with more enthusiastic people, bring some 
goal of life (Bhagawan ki bhakti).
* Increase studying quality and time.
> Study in morning.
> After afternoon, rajoguna becomes effective.
