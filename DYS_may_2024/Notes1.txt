(Discover Inner Self)

- Happiness means improved facilities for...
Eating, sleeping, mating, defending

Eating, sleeping, mating, defending

- In Eating, Sleeping, Mating & Defending
* Animals have Rational power & intelligence
* Animals are better than human beings

- Mahabharata shloka
āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca
sāmānyam etat paśubhir narāṇām
dharmo hi teṣām adhiko viśeṣo
dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ

Both animals and humans share the activities of
eating, sleeping, mating, and defending. 
But the special property of the humans is that they 
are able to engage in spiritual life. 
Therefore without spiritual life, humans are on the
level of animals.

न्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो
न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥ २० ॥

For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time.
He has not come into being, does not come into being, 
and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal,
ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.

- Body vs Soul
* Body
> Matter, not conscious, changes, temporary, dead
* Soul
> Spirit, conscious, not changes, permanent, alive

willing and intentionality.

बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जित: ।
अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत् ॥ ६ ॥

his mind will remain the greatest enemy.

* BG 13.8-12
अमानित्वमदम्भित्वमहिंसा क्षान्तिरार्जवम् ।
आचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यमात्मविनिग्रह: ॥ ८ ॥
इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च ।
जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम् ॥ ९ ॥
असक्तिरनभिष्वङ्ग: पुत्रदारगृहादिषु ।
नित्यं च समचित्तत्वमिष्टानिष्टोपपत्तिषु ॥ १० ॥
मयि चानन्ययोगेन भक्तिरव्यभिचारिणी ।

अध्यात्मज्ञाननित्यत्वं तत्त्वज्ञानार्थदर्शनम् ।
एतज्ज्ञानमिति प्रोक्तमज्ञानं यदतोऽन्यथा ॥ १२ ॥

Humility; pridelessness; nonviolence; tolerance; simplicity;
approaching a bona fide spiritual master; cleanliness;
steadiness; self-control; renunciation of the objects of
sense gratification; absence of false ego; the perception
of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; detachment;
freedom from entanglement with children, wife,
home and the rest; even-mindedness amid pleasant and
unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me; 
aspiring to live in a solitary place; detachment from the 
general mass of people; accepting the importance of 
self-realization; and philosophical search for the
Absolute Truth – all these I declare to be knowledge, and
besides this whatever there may be is ignorance.

- True happiness lies in finding the true cause of problems.

- Superficial patch up solutions cannot free us from suffering
* White hair - dye
* Pain - painkiller
* Science & Tech -> Cannot stop old age
> Hardly any understanding of life and death

- Real substance (spirit soul) is forgotten
* Shadow is material body

- Soul has body
* Wrong -> Body has soul

- Soul changes bodies
* 9 lakh aquatics
* 20 lakh trees
* 11 lakh insects & reptiles
* 10 lakh birds
* 30 lakh animals
* 4 lakh humans

- Where does the soul comes from
* Originally belongs to the spiritual world.
* There every word is a song
* There every walk is dance

- BG 15.6
न तद्भ‍ासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावक: ।
यद्ग‍त्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥ ६ ॥

That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun
or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach 
it never return to this material world.

- BG 8.20
परस्तस्मात्तु भावोऽन्योऽव्यक्तोऽव्यक्तात्सनातन: ।
य: स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति ॥ २० ॥

Yet there is another unmanifest nature, which is eternal
and is transcendental to this manifested and
unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never
annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, 
that part remains as it is.

- Why does the soul come to this material world.
* The material world is like a prison house
* Forgets his true identity

- The forgetful sould becomes attracted to the illusion
of material world

- We are like the lost son of millionaire father.

- God's energies
* Inferior - Material energy - Gross & subtle elements
* Superior - Soul - Sat-chit-anand

- BG 15.1
श्रीभगवानुवाच
ऊर्ध्वमूलमध:शाखमश्वत्थं प्राहुरव्ययम् ।
छन्दांसि यस्य पर्णानि यस्तं वेद स वेदवित् ॥ १ ॥

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that
there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots 
upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the 
Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of 
the Vedas.

- Material world is compared to hospital.

* Goal of life

- Why so many religions?
* Essential principles of all religions are same

> Glory of holy names

- Different scriptures - Meant for different audiences

- Sanatana Dharma vs Christianity

- Sanatana Dharma
* 'Dharma' mean 'that which cannot be given up'
'that which is a constant companion'
> Water & liquidity
> Salt & saltiness
> Fire & heat-light
* What is constant companion of living being?
'to love and to render service'
* Where should we repose our loving & serving propensity?
> Eternal love & service 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'

- How can we become happy?
* All the senses are nourished by feeling the stomach
* All the parts of the tree are nourished by watering the root
* The part (finger) can become happy only by serving the whole (stomach).
* The soul can become happy only by serving The Supreme Lord.

- ABCDE
