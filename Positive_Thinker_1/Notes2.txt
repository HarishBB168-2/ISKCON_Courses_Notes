मन्दा: सुमन्दमतयो मन्दभाग्या ह्युपद्रुता: ॥ १० ॥

O learned one, in this iron Age of Kali men almost
always have but short lives. They are quarrelsome,

तप्यन्ते लोकतापेन साधव: प्रायशो जना: ।
परमाराधनं तद्धि पुरुषस्याखिलात्मन: ॥ ४४ ॥

It is said that great personalities almost always
accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering

A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak,

Session 6 : 21.07.2024
Topic : The Trial
Speaker : [Movie]

- BG 2.2
श्री भगवानुवाच
कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् ।
अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥ २ ॥

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: 
My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon
you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows 
the value of life. They lead not to higher planets 
but to infamy.

- Atheistic point
* Big bang
> No mathematical equation
> Faith is required
> Questions
>> Ingredients
>> Who did this?
>> Explosion destroys & doesn't create
* Evolution theory
> Charles darwin theory
> There doesn't exist a linking species b/w
humans & monkeys.

- Consciousness makes worth of dead chemicals of body.

- Just like in dark room, we cannot see other
person, oneself etc.

- Illusory eyes
* Mirage, meeting of rail lines

- We cannot see -> mind, intelligence etc.

- Scriptures are like mother, tell us about our
father - Krishna

- Śrī brahma-saṁhitā 5.1
īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
anādir ādir govindaḥ
sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam

Kṛṣṇa who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead.
He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the 
origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the
prime cause of all causes.

- Mythology?
* Ayurveda
* Architecture in veda
* Predictions about various people
* Whole development of fetus is mentioned in 
scriptures

- Why believe, when a thing cannot be experimented 
by science.
* Senses are limited & illusory.
* Stephen constant has changed various times.

- Godless civilization is degrading.

- Before we had -> Now
* God coin -> Steel & paper currency
* Eat in gold/silver plate -> Eat in steel/plastic plate

- BG 9.31
क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति ।
कौन्तेय प्रतिजानीहि न मे भक्त: प्रणश्यति ॥ ३१ ॥

lasting peace. O son of Kuntī, declare it

Session 7 : 04.08.2024
Topic : Qualifications of an Ideal Disciple
Speaker : Vivek Goyal Prabhu Ji

- Who should go to guru?
- Qualifications of Arjun

- BG 2.7
कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः
पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः ।
यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्‍चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे
शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम् ॥ ७ ॥

Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all 
composure because of miserly weakness. In this 
condition I am asking You to tell me for certain
what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and
a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.

- In real life
* Also don't give advice, when not asked for
* Just like Krishna doesn't said anything, till
Arjun asked & surrenderd.

- What lesson you learn?

- Do disciple need to be qualified?
* Faith
* Surrender
* Unwavering surrender
* Following what you says

- Do a vaishnav guru sees qualification before
accepting disciple.

- BG 4.34
तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्न‍ेन सेवया ।
उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः ॥ ३४ ॥

Just try to learn the truth by approaching a 
spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively
and render service unto him. The self-realized 
souls can impart knowledge unto you because
they have seen the truth.

-
* Humble surrender
> E.g. -> Shri Sanatan Goswami Ji
> Perfect Questions?
> Who am I?
> 3 fold miseries?
* Inquisitiveness
> SB 2.1.2
श्रोतव्यादीनि राजेन्द्र नृणां सन्ति सहस्रश: ।
अपश्यतामात्मतत्त्वं गृहेषु गृहमेधिनाम् ॥ २ ॥

Those persons who are materially engrossed, 
being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, 
have many subject matters for hearing in human
society, O Emperor.
* Submissive service
* Devotion to the Supreme Lord
* Unflinching faith in the order of guru
> Guru Vandna 8th shloka
yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo
yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi
dhyāyan stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri-sandhyaṁ
vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam 

By satisfaction of the spiritual master, 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied.
And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is 
no chance of being promoted to the plane of Kṛṣṇa
consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray
for his mercy three times a day, and offer my 
respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.
> Is disciple allowed to argue to guru about truth?
* Avowed truthfulness
> If one wants a cheating guru, he will get a cheating
guru.

-------------------------------------
Session 8 : 11.08.2024
Topic : Law of Karma
Speaker : Vivek Goyal Prabhu Ji

- Logic of Karma
* Impartial & Inexorable (impossible to prevent)
> We can't breach God's laws, we can on ly break 
ourselves while trying to break.
Work on all living entity.
* Every cause has an effect.
> E.g. -> Action ⇌ Reaction
* Reward & Punishment

- Doubts about Karma
* Why do bad people flourish?
> Due to good deeds in previous lives.
* Karma stored in silos. (Silos storing harvested grains)
* Instant/delayed karma
* Why sufferings of past deeds?
> As different seed has different germination time & 
conditions.
> BG 4.17
कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः ।
अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः ॥ १७ ॥

The intricacies of action are very hard to understand.
Therefore one should know properly what action is, 
what forbidden action is and what inaction is.
>> Reason
>>> Death -> is a barrier in facing reaction in same life.
>>> Seeds -> Different germination time.
>>> Conditions -> Different conditions required.
>>> Body is dress -> Change of dress doesn't free from
reactions.

- Ignorance is not the reason for sin. But sin is the 
reason for ignorance.

- Just like when prisoner takes fight with counsellor
and put into dark jail in isolation. Similarly, when a
person ignores spiritual counsellor and does sin, then
that person takes birth in a family/society, where there
aren't any spiritual counsellor (e.g. -> in remote tribal
area, china, usa, yavan people).

- Doubts
* Group karma -> Earthquake, tsunami etc killing 1000s of
people.

-------------------------------------
Session 9 : 18.08.2024
Topic : Law of Karma 2
Speaker : Vivek Goyal Prabhu Ji

- Science of Karma
* Karma account is like bank account
> 2 bank account -> Paap, punya
> Sanchit Karma -> Total karma of a jiva
> Prarabdh -> Karma reaction to be faced in a body.
>> A part is taken from Sanchit Karma

- Karma types
1. Karma -> Action according to scriptures.
2. Vikarma -> Action against scriptures.
3. Akarma -> Action that free us from birth-death cycle.

- Destiny/fate is same as Prarabdh.
* ~ is reaction to face of old karmas.
* ~ is product of free will excercised in previous life.

- Free will
* ~ is influenced with association.
* Avoid misuse. Do proper use of freewill.

- 2 extremes
1. Karmavat - All things under my control.
2. Daivyavat - All things are under destiny's control.
* Truth is that -> We need to have balanced approach.

- Fear of God is beginning of wisdom.

- Akrama
* Action connected to God.
* Sewa of God.
* Navdha Bhakti
> Shravanam, Kirtanam, Smaranam, Archanam,
Vandanam, Padsewanam, Dasyam, Sakhyam,
Atmanivedanam.
* Prasad pana
* BG 9.27
यत्करोषि यदश्न‍ासि यज्ज‍ुहोषि ददासि यत् ।
यत्तपस्यसि कौन्तेय तत्कुरुष्व मदर्पणम् ॥ २७ ॥

Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer
or give away, and whatever austerities you perform – 
do that, O son of Kuntī, as an offering to Me.

- Good Karma vs Akarma
* To take fruit of good karma, birth is required.
* Good karma is temporary.
* E.g. ->
> Free water distribution
>> Will take birth near river, or have no lack of water.
> Free notebook/book distributor
>> Will become owner of a book publisher company in 
next birth.

-
* When soldiers kill for govt., then is rewarded.
* When soldiers kill for some personal interest, then is
punished.

- Administrator for management of Karma of jivas.
* Supersoul in body is witness of all our activities.
* Supersoul give inspiration according to our karma &
desires.
* BG 15.15
सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो
मत्त: स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च ।
वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो
वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम् ॥ १५ ॥

I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all 
the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler
of Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.
