Session 12 : 15.09.2024
Topic : Shrimad Bhagavad Gita
Speaker : Shri Suraj Kumar Dvivedi Prabhu Ji

- Knowledge is important, but gives better result 
when applied.

- Miser vs Liberal
* Miser -> bodily conscious person .
> Eating, mating, sleeping, defending
* Liberal -> God conscious / Krishna conscious.

- BG 7.4
भूमिरापोऽनलो वायु: खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च ।
अहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा ॥ ४ ॥

Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence 
and false ego – all together these eight constitute
My separated material energies.

- Consciousness -> consciousness for soul is similar
to sunshine for sun.

- Shrimad Bhagavad Gita by Srila Prabhupada is dedicated
to Shri Baldeva Vidya Bhusan Ji.

- BG 2.13
देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा ।
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥ १३ ॥

As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body,
from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly 
passes into another body at death. A sober person is
not bewildered by such a change.

- Misery comes from miser.
* Miser leads to misery

- BG 2.20
न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचि-
न्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो
न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥ २० ॥

For the soul there is neither birth nor death at 
any time. He has not come into being, does not 
come into being, and will not come into being. 
He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. 
He is not slain when the body is slain.

- Misunderstanding -> I am special
* Yaksh asking to Shri Yuddhisthir Maharaj Ji
> What is wondrous thing in the world?
Ans -> Everyone is dying every moment, and everyone
thinks that they are special & will not die.

- 4 regulative principles
* No meat eating
* No intoxication
* No gambling
* No illicit sex

- BG 2.14
मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः ।
आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ॥ १४ ॥

O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of 
happiness and distress, and their disappearance 
in due course, are like the appearance and 
disappearance of winter and summer seasons. 
They arise from sense perception, O scion of 
Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them
without being disturbed.

- Veda-ved prakash will come when one identify
oneself as Krishna das / daseranudas.

- Peace, prosperity, satisfaction.
