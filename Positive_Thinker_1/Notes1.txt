सर्वोपनिषदो गावो
दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः
पार्थो वत्सः सुधीर्भोक्ता
दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत् |

word to word meaning:

sarva- all; upanishadho – Upanishads are; gavo- cows; dogdha- milker;
gopalanandana:- (is)the son of the cowherd ,( Krishna); partho- son
of prutha ,(Arjuna); vatsa:- (is the)calf; sudhee:- (the)men of
purified intellect; Bhoktha- (are the)drinkers; dugdham- (and the )
milk ; mahat- (is the)supreme; amrutam- nectar; gita- (of) Gita

sloka meaning:

(If)All upanishads are (likened to) cows. The milker is the son of
the cowherd, Krishna; Arjuna, son of prutha, is the calf; the men of
purified intellect are the drinkers and the milk is the supreme
nectar of Gita.

Highlights:

Vedas are the breath of the Lord. Upanishads are the defining points
of the vedas. Sort of crowns. All upanishads are compared to cows
here. If the milk is compared to Gita, then it means that the
knowledge attained through a devoted study of the Gita gives the
essence of all vedas ( and upanishads in turn). In many slokas
upanishadic verses are repeated verbatim in the Gita. Foreseeing the
difficulty of the forthcoming generations of kaliyuga vasis, Krishna
has prepared a digest of the consummate wisdom of the vedas and
presented them in his dialogue with Arjuna. Let us memorize this
sloka today. I believe you have memorized the previous three.

- 
एकं शास्त्रं देवकीपुत्रगीतम् ।
एको देवो देवकीपुत्र एव ।।
एको मन्त्रस्तस्य नामानि यानि।
कर्माप्येकं तस्य देवस्य सेवा ।।

“आज के युग में लोग एक शास्त्र, एक ईश्र्वर, एक धर्म तथा एक वृति के लिए अत्यन्त उत्सुक हैं। 
अतएव सारे विश्र्व के लिए केवल एक शास्त्र भगवद्गीता हो। सारे विश्र्व के लिए एक इश्वर
हो-देवकीपुत्र श्रीकृष्ण । एक मन्त्र, एक प्रार्थना हो- उनके नाम का कीर्तन, हरे कृष्ण,
हरे कृष्ण, कृष्ण कृष्ण, हरे हरे। हरे राम, हरे राम, राम राम, हरे हरे। केवल एक ही
कार्य हो – भगवान् की सेवा ।” (गीता महात्म्य ७)

- Why Dhritrashtra wasn't transformed
* BG 9.1
श्रीभगवानुवाच
इदं तु ते गुह्यतमं प्रवक्ष्याम्यनसूयवे ।
ज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽश‍ुभात् ॥ १ ॥

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna,
because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you
this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing
which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.
* When we are envious of God.
* When we are having enjoyer mentality
* When we are making ourselves equal to God or become competitor
* BG 9.2
राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम् ।
प्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम् ॥ २ ॥

This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret
of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because
it gives direct perception of the self by realization,
it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting,
and it is joyfully performed.

- Right mood of approaching BG
* This knowledge will remain confidential unless we
apply this knowledge in our life
* Learn from the author, how to approach this book.
Don't use it to promote your philosophy.
* It's the attitude not aptitude that decides the
altitude of our lives.
* Spirit behind the law is more important than
simply letter of the law.
* Ex -> The devotee south Indian Brahman reading BG
who won Lord Caitanya's heart.
* Make your choice. You want Me or My energy?
> Devotee -> Chooses to love and serve the Lord.
> Demon -> Chooses to exploit the resources of the
Lord for his own enjoyment.

- Relevance of BG today
* Today, computer, TV, mobile are invented to remove
pain of body.
> Now the only problem is that pain has gone from
body to mind.
* Bg has pur full stop on sufferings of people since
time immemorial. It can solve the real problems of
life - birth, old age, disease & death, which 
scientific advancement cannot solve.

(Aristotle)

- The Power of Habits
* Know about mind before knowing about habits.

are random and unecessary.

बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जित: ।
अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत् ॥ ६ ॥

For him who has conquered the mind, 
the mind is the best of friends; 
but for one who has failed to do so, 
his mind will remain the greatest enemy.

तस्याहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम् ॥ ३४ ॥
