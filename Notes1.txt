Title : The Search for Happiness

Do we have same goals or different?
Actually all have same goal that is happiness.

Algebra - revisited
Eating, sleeping, mating, struggle = Animal life
Human life = sophisticated (eating, sleeping, mating, struggle)
  = sophisticated (Animal life)

Common and Different
Common - Eating, sleeping, sex and defense
Different - Dharma

Does the below equation hold true?
Physical Comfots = Happiness ? 
This is false

On what we spend more time?
Please or quest for pleasure
Answer : quest for pleasure

Happiness means
Absence of pain OR forgetfulness of pain
Answer : Both are wrong

Is it true that in order to experience happiness, need to experience distress?
False. But 99% people believe that.
99% learn by experience and 1% who are intelligent learn by hearing.

Happiness Index of our life...
• Out of all we want to be happy in this world - how much we are able to achieve?
• Out of what we achieve - how much percentage is of what we actually wanted to achieve?
• Out of those things we achieve (and which we wanted to achieve) how
many keep giving us ever lasting happiness - which is our heart deep quest?

Let's hear the manufacturer - BG 8.15
Dukhalayam ashashvatam
Sukh ki aakanksha is not wrong
Sukh ki aakanksha in material world is wrong

Happiness Unleashed???
• We've conquered outer space, but not inner space
• We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul
• We'be split the atom, but not our prejudice
• We have higher incomes, but lower morals
• We've added years to life, not life to years.
We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet the new neighbour.

What are the obstacles to our happiness?
• Relative problems
Adhyatmika - bodily or mental pains
Adhibhautika pains - those offered by living creatures
Adhidaivika pains - those due to supernatural distrubances
• Relative Obstacles to Happiness
1. One's own body & mind
Some people has and some people doesn't
Mind gives more pains
Few ways to take pleasure from this body
Countless ways to take pains from this body
2. Natural disturbances
Some places has and some places doesn't
India has less natural distrubances
3. Other living entities
From other people, animals etc.
• Absolute Obstacles to Happiness
> One that is common to all, no one wants it, no one can avoid it
1. Birth
2. Old Age
3. Death
4. Disease
More hospitals are not indication of progress

Sense Gratification is Not the Source of Happiness
• Donkey gets stuck due to ignorance and dullness
Just like a carrot is hung in front of donkey. 
E.g. - employee running for promotion like a donkey
Due to foolishness
• Elephant is stuck due to running behind she elephant
Pleasure of genitals
• Fire moth is stuck due to jumping in fire to enjoy warmth
Pleasure of the skin
• Bumbulbee goes in lotus for enjoying smell and got stuck at night
when lotus closes at night.
Pleasure of nostrils
• Fish goes towards fishing rod bait.
Pleasure of tongue

- Summary of Today's session
• We all have a same goal - Happiness
• Without inquiring about the higher truths we are just "sophisticated animals"
• Happiness lies beyond matter.
• By making things better we cannot make this world a better place.
• More tims is spend in quest of pleasure than the pleasure itself.
• There are two obstacles to happiness
> Relative : Adhyatmika, Adhibhautika, Adhidaivika
> Absolute : Birth, old age, disease, death
• Senses are the hook to keep us in miserable condition of life 
(temporary pleasure, permanent distress)

Session 2 : 28.01.2024
Title : Does god exist

- For common people :-
Faith on god is situational (depending on situation)

- Proof of the Existence of God
1. For every urge there is fulfillment in nature
thrist - water, hunger - food, 
urge to admire/worship - admirable/worshipable objects
2. Creation implies creator
e.g. - presence of web implies presence of spider.
3. Law imply a Law Maker

- Definition of God
• Ultimate generator, operator and destroyer
• Source of everything
• Supreme Controller
• Supreme Proprietor
• Supreme Enjoyer
(How not to be envious of this fact?)

- 3 Ways of Acquiring Knowledge
1. Pratyaksha - knowing by senses
Evil, struggle, misery is nothing but absence of God.
Senses are imperfect.
Example - mind, intelligence, ego cannot be seen.
This is not perfect way to acquire knowledge.
2. Anuman - guessing
This is also not perfect.
3. Shabda - accepting the words of authority.
Example - asking the bus route from bus conductor,
asking mother about father.
Scripture (mother) telling about God (father).

- As it comes from the prefect source.
Vedic Knowledge is infallible
• Bhugol has Saptadvip
• Plants having Life
• Human embryology
• Vedic mathematics
• Ayurveda

• Predictions in Kali Yuga

- Why different Scriptures?
• Different scriptures are meant for different audience and
are revealed according to time place and circustance.
• Essence is the same
• Exoteric can be different

always worship the supreme, as obedient servants;
created by the supreme; exist withing material nature;
delegated with various grades of power to manage the affairs of
the universe; subordinate to the will of the supreme;
have material bodies, hence, subject to birt, old age, disease and death;
cond under the influence of the three material modes to different extents;
temporary posts;
• God - one; supreme whole; supremely worshipable;
supreme creator; beyond material creation; supreme controller;
supremely independent; completely spiritual body, no brith, old age,
disease and death; completely beyond the influence of the three
material modes; eternally the same supreme lord;
