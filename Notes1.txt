Session 1 : 21.01.2024
Title : The Search for Happiness

Do we have same goals or different?
Actually all have same goal that is happiness.

Algebra - revisited
Eating, sleeping, mating, struggle = Animal life
Human life = sophisticated (eating, sleeping, mating, struggle)
  = sophisticated (Animal life)

Common and Different
Common - Eating, sleeping, sex and defense
Different - Dharma

Does the below equation hold true?
Physical Comfots = Happiness ? 
This is false

On what we spend more time?
Please or quest for pleasure
Answer : quest for pleasure

Happiness means
Absence of pain OR forgetfulness of pain
Answer : Both are wrong

Is it true that in order to experience happiness, need to experience distress?
False. But 99% people believe that.
99% learn by experience and 1% who are intelligent learn by hearing.

Happiness Index of our life...
• Out of all we want to be happy in this world - how much we are able to achieve?
• Out of what we achieve - how much percentage is of what we actually wanted to achieve?
• Out of those things we achieve (and which we wanted to achieve) how
many keep giving us ever lasting happiness - which is our heart deep quest?

Let's hear the manufacturer - BG 8.15
Dukhalayam ashashvatam
Sukh ki aakanksha is not wrong
Sukh ki aakanksha in material world is wrong

Happiness Unleashed???
• We've conquered outer space, but not inner space
• We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul
• We'be split the atom, but not our prejudice
• We have higher incomes, but lower morals
• We've added years to life, not life to years.
We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet the new neighbour.

What are the obstacles to our happiness?
• Relative problems
Adhyatmika - bodily or mental pains
Adhibhautika pains - those offered by living creatures
Adhidaivika pains - those due to supernatural distrubances
• Relative Obstacles to Happiness
1. One's own body & mind
Some people has and some people doesn't
Mind gives more pains
Few ways to take pleasure from this body
Countless ways to take pains from this body
2. Natural disturbances
Some places has and some places doesn't
India has less natural distrubances
3. Other living entities
From other people, animals etc.
• Absolute Obstacles to Happiness
> One that is common to all, no one wants it, no one can avoid it
1. Birth
2. Old Age
3. Death
4. Disease
More hospitals are not indication of progress

Sense Gratification is Not the Source of Happiness
• Donkey gets stuck due to ignorance and dullness
Just like a carrot is hung in front of donkey. 
E.g. - employee running for promotion like a donkey
Due to foolishness
• Elephant is stuck due to running behind she elephant
Pleasure of genitals
• Fire moth is stuck due to jumping in fire to enjoy warmth
Pleasure of the skin
• Bumbulbee goes in lotus for enjoying smell and got stuck at night
when lotus closes at night.
Pleasure of nostrils
• Fish goes towards fishing rod bait.
Pleasure of tongue

- Summary of Today's session
• We all have a same goal - Happiness
• Without inquiring about the higher truths we are just "sophisticated animals"
• Happiness lies beyond matter.
• By making things better we cannot make this world a better place.
• More tims is spend in quest of pleasure than the pleasure itself.
• There are two obstacles to happiness
> Relative : Adhyatmika, Adhibhautika, Adhidaivika
> Absolute : Birth, old age, disease, death
• Senses are the hook to keep us in miserable condition of life 
(temporary pleasure, permanent distress)

Session 2 : 28.01.2024
Title : Does god exist

- For common people :-
Faith on god is situational (depending on situation)

- Proof of the Existence of God
1. For every urge there is fulfillment in nature
thrist - water, hunger - food, 
urge to admire/worship - admirable/worshipable objects
2. Creation implies creator
e.g. - presence of web implies presence of spider.
3. Law imply a Law Maker

- Definition of God
• Ultimate generator, operator and destroyer
• Source of everything
• Supreme Controller
• Supreme Proprietor
• Supreme Enjoyer
(How not to be envious of this fact?)

- 3 Ways of Acquiring Knowledge
1. Pratyaksha - knowing by senses
Evil, struggle, misery is nothing but absence of God.
Senses are imperfect.
Example - mind, intelligence, ego cannot be seen.
This is not perfect way to acquire knowledge.
2. Anuman - guessing
This is also not perfect.
3. Shabda - accepting the words of authority.
Example - asking the bus route from bus conductor,
asking mother about father.
Scripture (mother) telling about God (father).

- As it comes from the prefect source.
Vedic Knowledge is infallible
• Bhugol has Saptadvip
• Plants having Life
• Human embryology
• Vedic mathematics
• Ayurveda
• Astonishing Prediction
> Chaitanya Mahaprabhu SB 11.5.32
> Buddha SB 1.3.24
> Chanakya SB 12.1.11
> Chandragupta Maurya & King Ashoka SB 12.1.12
• Predictions in Kali Yuga
> Following will be diminshed day by day:-
Religiosity, truthfulness, cleanliness, tolerance,
mercy, duration of life, strength, memory

- Why different Scriptures?
• Different scriptures are meant for different audience and
are revealed according to time place and circustance.
• Essence is the same
• Exoteric can be different
• Essoteric is same
• Ganpati Ji wrote Bhagavad Gita

- Bhagvan - Possessor (van) of 6 Opulences (bhag)
• Beauty, wealth, strength, knowledge, fame, renunication

Session 3 : 04.02.2024
Title : Who am God?

• Source of everything : 
> Avatar
> Demigods

- Demigods vs God
• Demigods - many; parts and parcel; 
always worship the supreme, as obedient servants;
created by the supreme; exist withing material nature;
delegated with various grades of power to manage the affairs of
the universe; subordinate to the will of the supreme;
have material bodies, hence, subject to birt, old age, disease and death;
cond under the influence of the three material modes to different extents;
temporary posts;
• God - one; supreme whole; supremely worshipable;
supreme creator; beyond material creation; supreme controller;
supremely independent; completely spiritual body, no brith, old age,
disease and death; completely beyond the influence of the three
material modes; eternally the same supreme lord;
 
- Worship of demigods and God
• Demigods : Material desires, material & temporary, watering leaves,
gives what he wants,
• God : No material desires, intelligent & eternal, watering root,
gives what he needs,

Session 5 : 18.02.2024
Title : Why Do Bad Things Happen To Good People?

- Coming from book 
* Written by Harold Kushner (Rabbi in a chruch)

- Qualities of God in Bible
• All merciful
• All knowing
• All powerful

- Krishna is Sat-Cit-Ananda
• Jiva (soul) is also Sat-Cit-Ananda

- 5 major topics in Bhagavad Gita
• Isvara (god)
• Jiva (living entity)
• Prakriti (material nature)
• Kala (time)
• Karma (activity)

- Created many souls for
• Love
> Possible when there is choice
• Choice can be used (loving god) or misused (leaving god)
• Material world converts "leaving god" to "loving god".
• Cause of misery : desire to enjoy without god.

- Prakriti - The Material Nature
• Consists of millions of universes
• A fraction of the total creation
• Material nature is "dukhalayam ashvashvatam"
• Spiritual world is "Vaikuntha" (free of misery: dullness)
• Compared to a prison house. A facility provided for the
rebellious souls, giving them an opportunity to reform themselves.
• Why did the Lord create the material world?
> To reform our choices
• Provides the sould with a body in 8.4 million species
> Humanoid species : 4 lac
> Aquatics : 9 lac
> Avians (birds) : 10 lac
> Animals : 30 lac
> Plants : 20 lac
> Insects : 11 lac
• Different bodies provide different levels of consciousness just like
different cells in the prison.
• A- Class Cell, B- Class Cell & C-Class cell
• Binds the body with the three modes of nature.
• Durga
> Ga - get out, Dur - very difficult

- 3 modes of Material nature
• Sattva Guna
> Knowledge (learners), free from sins, conditioned by sens of happiness
• Rajo Guna
> Unlimited desires, fruitive activity, attraction between man and woman
• Tamo Guna
> Madness, laziness, sleep, intoxication
• Everyone has all 3 modes
• Find most dominant : what are you doing, when you are alone.
• Foods in
> Mode of goodness
Food that increases life span & heart becomes purified
Gives strength, health, happiness and satisfaction
Such foods are juicy, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart
> Mode of passion
Foods that cause distress. misery and ill-health
Such foods are too bitter, too sour, salty, very hot, pungent,
dry and burning
> Mode of ignorance
Prepared more than 3 hrs before being eaten
Induces lethargy, etc
Consisting of remnants.
Fungus (mushrooms), onion, garlic etc.

- The Conditioned Soul
• All living beings in the material world are conditioned by the three modes.
• The soul comes in contact with a particular mode of material nautre and acts accordingly, being conditioned
• We seek happiness on the material platform according to the modes we are conditioned by
• We are forced to act helpelessly according to the impulses born of the modes of nautre
• Thus our pure spiritual nature is perverted by the impure desires, born of the three modes

- Karma (Activity)
• Definition : Activities performed by the living entities conditioned by the three modes, under the control and purview of time.
• The Law Of Karma : For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
• We are accountable for everything we think, speak or do. Therefore we must be aware of the consequences of all the activites that we perform.

- Preliminary knowledge of the Law of Karma
• It is very difficult to understand the law of karma
Laws of karma - are relative
Good karma - virtuous activity (sugar coated poison)
Bad karma - sinful activity (poison)

- 4 Pillars of sinful life
• Illicit sex : sex outside marriage, inside marriage for exploitation
Destorys purity
• Intoxication : destroys tapasya (austerity)
• Gambling : destroys satya (truthfulness)
• Meat eating : destroys daya (mercy)
• Regulatory concession given does not mean free license to engage
in sinful activity.

- I have a question
Q1 : Why God gives us so much suffering?
Q2 : Karma hi puja hai... Haw far is this correct?
> Karma is duty.
Q3 : What about animals... are they too bound by karma?
Q4 : What about Tsunami, earth quake where so many people die together?
> Due to group karma.
Q5 : Is ignorance of the law cause to escape reaction?
Q6 : If everything is predestined then why work?
> Extremes :-
Bhagyawadi : everything is fixed, so don't work
Karmwadi : nothing is fixed, everything is in our hand
Actual reality :-
Is in between the 2. something is fixed and something is not.
What is predestined and what is not?
The thing I am experiencing now (health, wealth, mental status) is prefixed.
The choices I make during experiencing is in our hand.
Q7 : Good and bad karma do not cancel each other? Ans : No.
Q8 : Bad karma is bad... but how about good
Q9 : So, should we become lazy people?
• With astrology we can read karma.

- Solution
• To escape reaction "A-Karma must be performed"
• Doing karma for pleasure of God.
• Life is a preparation, death is the examination.
• No date sheet, question paper is leaked.

- Different types of Karma
• Karma : as per scriptural (pious) directions
• Vi-karma : against scriptural directions (sinful)
• A-karma : for which one does not suffer any reaction

- Questions regarding "Akarma"
Q1 : Why do we need God as a center? Just be good and do good to others?
Q2 : How Akaram is superior to good karma?
Q3 : How to practically implement Akarma in our daily life?
