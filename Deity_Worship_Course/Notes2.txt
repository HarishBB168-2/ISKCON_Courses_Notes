How to build mandir/altar

- Bhagwan ne Vigraha sewa ke bare 
me bataya hai
* SB 11.27
* Uddhava ji ne prashn pucha hai

- Bhagwan ka archa vigraha kaise
kaise banaya ja sakta hai?
* SB 11.27.12
शैली दारुमयी लौही लेप्या लेख्या च सैकती ।
मनोमयी मणिमयी प्रतिमाष्टविधा स्मृता ॥ १२ ॥

The Deity form of the Lord is said
to appear in eight varieties — stone,
wood, metal, earth, paint, sand,
the mind or jewels.
* SB 11.27.13
चलाचलेति द्विविधा प्रतिष्ठा जीवमन्दिरम् ।
उद्वासावाहने न स्त: स्थिरायामुद्धवार्चने ॥ १३ ॥

The Deity form of the Lord, who is
the shelter of all living entities, 
can be established in two ways: 
temporarily or permanently. 
But a permanent Deity, having been 
called, can never be sent away, 
My dear Uddhava.
* SB 11.27.14
अस्थिरायां विकल्प: स्यात् स्थण्डिले तु भवेद् द्वयम् ।
स्‍नपनं त्वविलेप्यायामन्यत्र परिमार्जनम् ॥ १४ ॥

The Deity that is temporarily established
can optionally be called forth and sent
away, but these two rituals should always
be performed when the Deity is traced upon
the ground. Bathing should be done with 
water except if the Deity is made of 
clay, paint or wood, in which cases a 
thorough cleansing without water is enjoined.
* Archa-Vigraha can be mady in 8 varieties
* Archa-Vigraha can be established in 2 ways :
Permanently or Temporarily.
* 8th variety (mind) is for advanced shuddh bhakt.
> All kanisth bhakt should use remaining
7 varieties

- Bhagwan ki sewa karne ki yogyata
* Jab hamara hridaya aur man
> Shuddh ho jayega
> kaam, krodh, lobh, moha, mad, matsarya
se mukt ho jaye
* Lekin hum suddh hote he bhagwan ki
sewa karke.
* Suddh honse se pehle bhi sewa karni he
aur baad mai bhi sewa hi karenge.

chahiye.

hai.
> Adhyatmik jivan me adhik mahatvapurna hai.
> Tulsi Maharani ki kripa se bhakti mai 
teji se unnati ho sakta hai.
* Sirf Vishnutatva ko hi arpit kiya ja sakta hai.
Nahi to apradh lagta hai.
