- What do we mean by meditation?

* Meditation means stopping all nonsensical activites, at least for the time being.
* Meditation means thinking of Krishna always (satatam cintayanot mam)
* Meditation means to achieve a state in which the mind is saturated with God consciousness.
* Meditation means to try to understand one's relationship with the Supreme.
* Meditation means analyzing the self and searching for the Absolute Truth.

* As per Brihad Naradiya Purana - 
Harer Namaiva Kevalam.
* Shrimad Bhagavatam - Kaler dosha-nidhe rajan
* Problems infront of Shri Bhimsen
> Symptoms of Kaliyuga
1. Bada eaten the kheti - rakshak becoming bhakshak
2. Glasses filled from jug cannot fill the jug - parents can grow the children, but children can't take care of parents.
3. Hathi can go through hole of needle, but tail of hathi is stuck in the hole - Big criminal are free, but small criminal in jails.
4. Cow killed the calf and eaten - Mothers will kill the baby in their womb selfishly.
5. Boy in neighbourhood bounds the mountains with thread and destorys them - Hari naam will destory mountains of sins.

- Hari naam glories
* Simply by chanting one holy name of Hari, a sinful man can counteract the reactions to more sins than he is able to commit. (Brihad Vishnu Purana)
* Naam-apradh :- using hari naam as washing intentional sins, will create 5 million times result of sins.
* Chanting of Lord Hari's name cures all diseases, removes all obstacles, and rescues one from all calamities. (Brihad Vishnu Purana)
* It is the nature of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra that anyone who chants it immediately devlops his loving ecstasy for Krishna. (Skanda Purana)
* In the relative world, the word water and the substance water are different. When I am thirsty, if I simply chant "Water, water, water," my thirst will not be satisfied. I require the real water. That is the nature of the relative world and relative consciousness. But in the spiritual world or spiritual consciousness, the chanting twenty-four hours a day, you'll never become tired. This is the spiritual nature of the Absolute Truth. This is practical. Anyone can perceive it. -- Srila Prabhupada.
